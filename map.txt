""Since the late 1990s, much of Donnelly’s work has been concerned with the transmission of messages from distant times and places, encrypted or distorted like the word-of-mouth accounts of her unrecorded performances, which she prefers to call ‘demonstrations’. Her diverse artistic production, which encompasses drawings, photographs, sculptures, films, and audio works, thus conflates the technological and spiritualist connotations of the term ‘medium’. Responding to this eclectic body of work, curator Hamza Walker has written: ‘Although it is tempting to cast her as the consummate post-medium artist, in her case that is already an over-determined category, for Donnelly genuinely has no medium. If anything she is a pre-medium artist, where “medium” could just as soon refer to a psychic.’4 Indeed, Donnelly’s practice exposes the roaming polysemy of the term ‘medium’ – as an intervening substance, a set of artistic conventions, a technology of communication, and a psychic intermediary. The waveform, which spans individual media and transcends the limits of human consciousness, offers a means of conceptualising this perpetual transgression of modalities and boundaries."
